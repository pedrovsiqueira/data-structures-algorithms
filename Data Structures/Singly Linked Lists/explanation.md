A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.

Linked lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

Big O

insertion - O(1);
Removal - O(1) if beginning or O(n) if removing from the end.
Searching - O(n);
Access - O(n)

Single linked lists are excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion
at the beginning are frequently required.

Arrays contain a built in index whereas Linked Lists do not.

The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other
data structures like stacks and Queues.
